## 💡 About Me

I’m a **former Accountant** who took a bold step into the world of **Cybersecurity and Networking** — driven by curiosity, discipline, and a passion for protecting systems and people.  
With my background in finance, I bring precision and an analytical mindset to everything I do.  
Now I’m a **Cybersecurity Student** dedicated to mastering secure networks, Linux systems, and ethical hacking.  

Outside of tech, I love **cooking, reading, and spending time with my family** — they keep me grounded and motivated to keep learning every day.
